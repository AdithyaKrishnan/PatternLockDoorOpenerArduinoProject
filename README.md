# PatternLockDoorOpenerArduinoProject

This is the source code of the project which I and my team created to open doors using pattern lock (similar to pattern lock on phones) using an ARDUINO UNO board.

Refer the circuit Diagram and use a LCD Screen and a Servo Motor.

Change the Default pattern if you wish to.

Run it.

Servo works(Door opens) only for correct pattern and wrong patterns are ignored.
